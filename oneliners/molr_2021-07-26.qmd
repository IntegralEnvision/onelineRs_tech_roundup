Do you need to know the object type of a variable in R? `class(<x>)` to the rescue! This returns information about the type of object such as character, numeric etc. Available base classes can be seen in the reference below.

Note that numeric is the numerical object data type. There isn't an integer / float type.
 
Happy Coding!
