Both `=` and `<-` can be used for assignment operators such as

    x <- 1

However, `=` can also be used as something called a syntax token, such as a named argument in a function. Here is a description of this that I found useful:

<https://developer.r-project.org/equalAssign.html>

\[= assignment is\] allowed in only two places in the grammar: at the top level (as a complete program or user-typed expression); and when isolated from surrounding logical structure, by braces or an extra pair of parentheses.

For example,

    x = 1 or func (x = NA)

`<-` and also `->` don't have this duality. `<-` and `->` only call the same assignment in their use. You can't use them as a named argument unlike `=`.

I tend to use `<-` everywhere except in functions as it seems to follow conventions here and what I see on the internet. Since Python uses `=` this took some getting used to.
