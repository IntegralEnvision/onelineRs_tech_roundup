Here's a neat Base R function, `rle()`. `rle()` is a named for run length encoding. In cases where you may have data that has streaks or runs of values, `rle()` gives you the length of the run and the value associated with the run.

Some places where this is useful are head/tail counting in coin flips (How many heads in a row do I get?), time series analysis (how many times does x happen?)

For example, we may have data that's a series of TRUE or FALSEs. `rle()` can take vector and give information about the streak or number of consecutive TRUE and FALSEs.

Here, `rle()` has returned an `rle()` object, which is a list of two elements, lengths and and values. "lengths", or `rle(z)[[1]]` above is an integer vector of the number of items in a run. In z, there are 2 TRUEs, 2 FALSEs followed by 1 TRUE and the rest of the runs. You can see this is summarized as 2, 2, 1. The values component of `rle()` (accessible by `rle(z)[2]]` here), indicates the three values in the first three runs are TRUE, FALSE, TRUE

Feel free to add other examples of where `rle()` would be useful in your work!
