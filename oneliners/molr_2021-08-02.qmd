The read_csv function is an alternative to the read.csv function found in base R. read_csv is part of the readr package, which is part of the tidyverse, and loads data as a tibble rather than a traditional R dataframe.

Importing data via read_csv

-   will load faster

-   doesn't change input types (looking at you strings as factors)

-   allow non-standard variable names (i.e. your variables can start with a number and can contain spaces)

-   never creates row names

Happy coding!
