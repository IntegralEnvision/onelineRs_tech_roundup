`dplyr::case_match()` is a new function in dplyr 1.1 that works as a vectorized switch().  It is similar to case_when() but is simpler if the value on the left side of your testing formula is the same for all tests.  The following are equivalent:

```{r, eval = F} 
library(dplyr)

case_when(
  x %in% c("a", "b") ~ 1,
  x %in% "c" ~ 2,
  x %in% c("d", "e") ~ 3
)

case_match(
  x,
  c("a", "b") ~ 1,
  "c" ~ 2,
  c("d", "e") ~ 3
)
```
