`expansion()` is a convenient way to expand your plot scales in ggplot. `expand()` expands both sides of the scale while `expansion()` is a multiplicative or additive function to expand both or either ends of a scale on a plot. The below example expands by multiplication with the y min by 1% and the y max by 10%

`scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0.01, 0.1))) +`
