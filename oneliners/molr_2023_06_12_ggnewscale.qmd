There can be cases where you need to specify two different scales for the same aesthetic in a ggplot (for instance you want viridis for the `color` aesthetic of one set of points, and rainbow for the `color` aesthetic of a second set of points). `ggplot2` won't allow two different scales for the same aesthetic - it will throw a warning and only use the most recent definition. The `ggnewscale` package provides a simple solution to this.

# Example

From the `ggnewscale` [documentation](https://eliocamp.github.io/ggnewscale/):

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggnewscale) #install.packages("ggnewscale")
# Equivalent to melt(volcano)
topography <- expand.grid(x = 1:nrow(volcano),
                          y = 1:ncol(volcano))
topography$z <- c(volcano)

# point measurements of something at a few locations
set.seed(42)
measurements <- data.frame(x = runif(30, 1, 80),
                           y = runif(30, 1, 60),
                           thing = rnorm(30))

ggplot(mapping = aes(x, y)) +
  geom_contour(data = topography, aes(z = z, color = after_stat(level))) +
  # Color scale for topography
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "D") +
  # geoms below will use another color scale
  new_scale_color() +
  geom_point(data = measurements, size = 3, aes(color = thing)) +
  # Color scale applied to geoms added after new_scale_color()
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "A")

```
