Both `print()` and `message()` are handy ways to see how your script is progressing. However, `print()` lacks concatenation in its output and also prints the element index which may or may not be useful. To use `print()` and multiple elements you have to use `paste()` or `paste0()`.

`message()` concatenates as needed.

`message()` has some other nice features as well such as printing to stderr and providing an error state. Check it out!
