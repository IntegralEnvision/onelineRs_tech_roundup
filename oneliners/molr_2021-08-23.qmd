Columns names that start with a number like 2021_data must start and end with a backtick " \` " to work with base R and dplyr verbs.

The action parts of dplyr such as `select()`, `mutate()` and `group_by()` are referred to as verbs. This comes from the idea that dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, like ggplot is grammar of graphics. On my US qwerty keyboard that character is above and to the left of the tab key.

In example, Here's an error if a backtick is not used ![](images/backtick1.png)

The correct approach

The janitor package can also clean names to making working with these type of names easier. ![](images/backtick4.png)
