If you come across reference to a function, but it isn't clear what package it is from (most often in example code or stack overflow), the `sos::findFn()` function can help. It will search a database of CRAN packages and return a list of packages that contain a matching function and list them in order of likelihood.  Unlike `??`, this searches all CRAN packages, not just ones installed on your system.

```{r}
sos::findFn("skim")
```
