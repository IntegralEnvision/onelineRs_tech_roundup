Would you like to know what index the min and max are at in a vector? `which.min()` and `which.max()` help.
In the example below the first min of -3 is at an index of 3 and the max of 9 is at an index of 5. Note these only return the first occurrence.

What if we want all the mins? Putting a logical expression in the which does this.
