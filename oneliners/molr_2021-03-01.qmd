Do you want a one liner to stop your code if something's not the way you expect. This allows your script to stop and message in undesired cases. For Python users, this is R's version of the assert statement

There's a few options:

if / stop option `if(blahdiblah) stop("error message")` ![](images/stop1.png)

`stopifnot()` is a little more descriptive `stopifnot(blahdiblah)` ![](images/stop2.png)

The `assert_that()` from tidyverse's assertthat is even more so: ![](images/stop3.png)
