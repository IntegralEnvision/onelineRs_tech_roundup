I was curious if there were R regular expression builders out there.

RVerbalExpressions is one. The source is here: <https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/RVerbalExpressions>

You can install from CRAN using `install.packages("RVerbalExpressions")`

It uses pipes to construct expressions. Last week's examples can be mimicked using

    x <- rx() %>% rx_anything_but(value ="UI ")
    # for the extraction to work any leading or trailing whitespace needs to be removed
    c("0.045 U", " 91", "0.037 I", "0.00046U") %>% trimws %>% str_extract(x)

Check it out. It might work well for your regex case!
