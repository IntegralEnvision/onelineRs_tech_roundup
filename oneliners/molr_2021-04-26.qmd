The `row.names()` function R returns the row names of a dataframe. It also helps you reset a row index.

For the mtcars dataset below, `row.names()` returns the car model, which is the dataset's row index.

If you ever need to reset your row index, say after slicing, you can do that with `row.names(<dataframe>) <- NULL` Here's I've reset the mtcars row names to a number rather than the car model.
