In R, numbers are a vector with length 1. The example below shows an input of 1 returns a vector with an index of 1, denoted by \[1\], and the value 1.

c stands for combine. In the example below when you type `c(c(1,2), c(3))`, R concatenates or combines the 1 or multi length vectors into a single vector of length 3 with an index of 1.

`c()` can combine more than just vectors. It can be used to combine lists and many other vector like objects.

For more information on vectors and `c()` there's also the R intro PDF. Search for `c()`.
