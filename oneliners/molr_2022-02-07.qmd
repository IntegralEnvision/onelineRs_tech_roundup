Have you ever wondered about the `options()` at the top of your R code? I've seen it used for displaying number formats or to set strings not to factors.

You can also use it to turn warnings into errors that will stop your code from running. By default, R keeps running despite any warnings. Use warn = 2 to error, causing a stop on warnings.

There are many more options for `options()`. See the references for more.
