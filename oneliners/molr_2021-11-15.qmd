Have you ever noticed the conflict warnings when loading a package in R?

Maybe you care that filter, lag etc are masked from other packages. Maybe you are comfortable with dplyr masking them. To hide conflict warnings you can use warn.conflicts = FALSE. F can be used as a shorthand for FALSE

Happy coding!
