This may be the first dplyr entry, which is a package of the tidyverse. We'll come back to that in a future post! More below if interested.

Given a set of vectors, `coalesce()` finds the first non missing value at each position. This is inspired by SQL's COALESCE which does the same thing for NULLs instead of NAs.

Here, "thing 3" replaces the NA in the first vector below

Here's switching the order where "one fish" replaces NA.

This can be pretty helpful in combining columns (like coordinates and keeping the first non NA value). Remember, this returns the first, so ordering is important.

Happy coding!
