R has base functions for `union()` and `intersect()`. A union is a set that is made up of all members passed to the set.

Today's one liner is about `intersect()`. An intersection is the set of members of each original set that are in both. In the example below only 3, 5, 7 and 13 are in both a and b vectors.

Where this gets more interesting is that you can use it for character vectors as well. Say, in finding the common columns that you want to row bind together.
