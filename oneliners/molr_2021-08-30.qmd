`seq()` is used in R for sequence number generation. It accepts either integers or decimal numbers. Its most basic form is `seq(from, to)` and includes the from value. Its an inclusive bound or range.

Finally, there's an 'along.with' parameter that allow you to specify a desired length, by the length of the argument passed. Here, I've created an input vector of length 5.
