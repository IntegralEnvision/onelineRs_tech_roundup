`pull()` is a `dplyr()` function that returns a vector (1- dimensional array of data). Its similar to the `$` in base R and may be helpful when chaining or piping in R. After loading tidyverse using `library(tidyverse)` and the Palmer Penguins data using `library(palmerpenguins)`. I was able to use `pull()` to get a species list.
