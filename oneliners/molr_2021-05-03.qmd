The `case_when()` function in R's dplyr package vectorizes `ifelse()` statements. It's based in SQL's CASE WHEN statement. It works especially well when making a new column in dataframe that is dependent on values in other columns.

I like this example with the Star Wars dataset. Note that the `TRUE ~ "other"` sets all instances where neither condition is met to "other", rather than NA.
